This project was an exercise in IEEE 754 Floating Point representation and arithmetic. It provides a library of functions for arithmetic on Standard Binary Floating Point (SBFP) types (see sbfp_t in sbfp_lib.h). The SBFP type format follows the IEEE 754 standard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754), albeit with only 16 bits of precision. No 'main' function is provided for testing.
